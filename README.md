Ascii-Cam
=========

This is a simple proof-of-concept I wrote to get familiar with Objective-C and the Cocoa frameworks.
The program uses live camera feed (OSX only, iOS coming soon), and uses OpenGL shaders to render a live, 'filtered' video.
Currently the program only uses a single shader--an ASCII shader--but will support multiple shaders in the future.
